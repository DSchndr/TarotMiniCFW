# TarotMiniCFW
Vaporesso Tarot Mini to Nano firmware

Adds stuff like Puff counter, Wattage for VT, Strength in Watt mode, Smart mode, Screen Brightness/Timeout,... that is missing in latest Tarot Mini FW :(

## Installing

1)  Get official updater from here: https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2191257/downloads/tarot_mini_20170316_V1.2.rar
2)  Download the modded Firmware from this Github repository
3)  Install the official updater
4)  Press the fire button, plug in USB cable
5)  In E-Ciga go to "ROM Update" and select the modded FW & press "Download"
6)  Remove USB cable and you should have Tarot Nano FW on your Tarot Mini :)

(PS: Hold Fire and - button to access settings menu)

## Extras

Apparently Tarot Nano, Mini and Pro (160W) use the same MCU and therefore the software can be interchanged.

You can use Pro FW on Nano/Mini **BUT** due to the Tarot Pro having 2 Battaries you need to patch out the first battery or add an hardware hack to force it to 100%
else your box will just reboot eternaly. (Also when you plan on doing it, just change the 80W max to your desired value in this FW :P )

Also Nano and Mini FW can run on Pro but one battery isn't going to be monitored and can be discharged deeply, **bad stuff can happen**,...


## Disclaimer
It is your decision to install this FW, not mine. 

I am not responsible for Exploded Batteries, Burning ("Brandheisse") mods that burn something down and all the other "fun stuff".
